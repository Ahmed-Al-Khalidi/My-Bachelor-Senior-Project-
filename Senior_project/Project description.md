This project aims to replace the call reservations and security guards at the gates of cooperationâ€™s and 
companies with an intelligent automated system, reducing traffic jams as well as the expenditures of 
any institute that's wishing to have such a service on board. This system depends on machine learning 
specifically, image processing, and Internet of things technologies.The automatic 
process for entering a given company gate is delineated by two scenarios, the first scenario plays out for 
employees and the second one regards any visitors of a given company. 


For the employees, the device must recognize their faces, and with no doubt, the device has a database 
that includes all the employees' faces. 


For the visitors, they need to register their names and 
email addresses on a website, the IoT comes here, when a visitor registers their name and email 
address, this new piece of information will be added to the database, this database is an SQL 
database located in the cloud. So, after adding the information the system will send an email to 
the visitor, this email includes the barcode, the visitor shall show this barcode the next day to the 
device so that it can detect whether the barcode is included in the device' database or not.
