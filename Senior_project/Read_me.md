This project aims to replace the call reservations and security guards at the gates of cooperationâ€™s and 
companies with an intelligent automated system, reducing traffic jams as well as the expenditures of 
any institute that's wishing to have such a service on board. This system depends on machine learning 
specifically, image processing, and Internet of things technologies.The automatic 
process for entering a given company gate is delineated by two scenarios, the first scenario plays out for 
employees and the second one regards any visitors of a given company.
